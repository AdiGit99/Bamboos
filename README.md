# Bamboos

This is a self-initiated project to build a web application that can facilitate scheduling, payment and other advanced features for the Hong Kong based company Bamboos
Healthcare Holdings Limited (Bamboos). Briefly, Bamboos is a B2B service that connects registered healthcare personnel with clients such as hospitals, elderly homes etc. 
When I first interned at this company, I was an industrial engineer but I soon realized that the technology of this company was outdated compared to other prominent 
B2B business companies such as Uber, Airbnb etc. Being an product-centric software enthusiast, I decided to start this project to learn more programming techniques and
apply them to a real world project. You can read more about this project on my portfolio at https://adriantse.com. This project is still ongoing and I hope to present this to the company later on as I have kept in touch with the company's CEO. 

Some technolgies used are:
- MERN stack
- socket.io
- Github

To be done:
- Payment page
- File upload page
- Figuring out how to incorporate CRM
- Scheduling feature
